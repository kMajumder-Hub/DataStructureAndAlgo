# Analysis
## Task0
Time Complexity is **O(1)** 
## Task 1
Since I am sequentially accessing both files, the time complexity is **O(n)**
## Task 2
The time complexity for this task is **O(n*^2)** since there is a for loop inside a for loop
## Task 3
The time complexity for this task is **O(nlogn)** since I am using the sort method which has complexity
of O(nlogn).
## Task 4
The time complexity for this task is **O(n^2)** since since there is a for loop inside a for loop
of O(nlogn).
